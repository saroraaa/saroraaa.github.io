                                <p> 
                                My name is <b> Shania Arora </b> and I am currently a <i> senior </i> at the <i> University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign </i>, majoring in <b> Computer Engineering. </b> <br> <br>

                                I started programming when I was 13 and the first thing I ever coded was a "Whale" class using Java. My favorite languages are <b> Python and C. </b> <br> <br>

                                I really enjoy <b> networking, back-end development, low-level programming, and security </b>. I discovered my love for networking while interning at <b> Juniper Networks </b> on the <b>  Platforms team </b> in Summer 2019.

                                <br> <br> I am originally from <i> New Jersey </i>, however I have picked up quite a few midwest attributes since going to college in Illinois. In my free time, I like to watch weight train, play piano, and watch shows such as Suits, Game of Thrones, etc.
